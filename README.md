## Inspiration

Our app was inspired by the growing concern for overconsumption and waste, and the increasing focus on recycling, reusing, and reducing waste in our daily lives. We recognized the potential for bartering and reusing items as a way to reduce waste and help alleviate supply chain issues. However, we also understand the risks involved in meeting with strangers for these transactions. Thus, we aimed to create a safe and secure platform for resellers to connect with buyers and reduce waste in a responsible and sustainable way. With our app, users can make meaningful and eco-friendly transactions, while also ensuring their safety and privacy.

## What it does

Our app provides a fast and easy way for users to connect with others and arrange secure meetings at safe locations. Upon signing up, the user can create an exchange or meeting by selecting a date and time, and sending an invite to the other user. The app then finds a safe place at a midpoint between the two users, which can include police and fire stations, as well as hospitals. Using the Google Maps API, users can view the location in detail and make any necessary edits or cancellations. The app also keeps track of all open meetings, providing a centralized platform for users to manage their exchanges. With our app, users can make secure and responsible transactions without the hassle or risks of meeting with strangers.
## How we built it

React Rails MUI GoogleMapsApi

## Challenges we ran into

During the final night of the hackathon, we encountered a series of issues stemming from Github pushing and pulling. Unfortunately, three out of the four members on our team experienced app crashes, which threatened to derail our progress. As morale was deteriorating after a couple hours of debugging, our 4th member's quick thinking and problem-solving skills helped us pull through.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Despite the challenges we faced, our team was able to come together and overcome the obstacles to produce a successful result. We are incredibly proud of the many accomplishments we achieved during the hackathon. One of our biggest successes was mastering the features of the Google Maps API, including geolocation and direction services. This allowed us to create a seamless and user-friendly experience for our app's users. We also utilized MUI to design a sleek and modern interface that was both intuitive and visually appealing. In addition, we implemented a secure login system using Ruby on Rails, sessions, and bcrypt, which ensured that users could access our app safely and with confidence.

## What we learned

Participating in our first hackathon was a valuable learning experience for all of us. In just 36 hours, we were able to accomplish a great deal and realized the potential for rapid progress and innovation. We also discovered the importance of time management and how quickly it can pass when encountering roadblocks. Additionally, we gained a deep understanding of the various features of the Google Maps API and how they can be utilized to improve our app's functionality. Overall, the hackathon taught us many important lessons and helped us develop our skills as a team.

## What's next for MeetSafe

In addition to our core accomplishments, we have also identified many potential areas for further development and expansion. For example, we recognize the value of user settings and exchange history, which could provide our users with even more control and oversight over their transactions. We also see the potential for integrating cryptocurrency payments, which could expand our user base and provide greater flexibility and security for transactions. Finally, we believe that integrating our app with popular platforms such as Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist could provide even greater convenience and accessibility for our users, allowing them to connect with a wider audience and enjoy even more seamless transactions. We are excited about these potential functionalities and look forward to exploring them in the future.
